What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	A hidden directory gets created along with the meta information needed to support the repository

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

	The staging area allows you to add some of the files in the directory and not just all of them to give you more granular support of the logical divisions which make up a commit
	
How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

	You can check the diff between working and commit to staging and make sure of what changes you are committing regardless of what you've worked on

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?

	Performing tests and new directions for the code (rabbit holes)

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

	Because branches are so similar from a functional level that they look alike without some visual aids
	
What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?

	The result is that the diverging branches can be brought back together to either update the master or a branch to the latest state
	
What are the pros and cons of Git's automatic merging vs. always doing merges
manually?

	Automatic merging is great if everything works out, but it is better to have manual when the answer requires a judgement call
	Conflict resolution is rarely something a computer can handle, but it can merge similar things easily.
