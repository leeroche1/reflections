When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  When you have a quick change, idea, or fix and don't have access to your usual workstation.
  You have the incorrect belief that web-apps are preferable to synced local apps.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    You might not be ready to pull changes if you are in a multiple contributor repository

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

	A fork is a clone of a Github repository and is used primarily for when you do not have permission to publish back or want to experiment in a different direction
	A clone is either local or between local and GitHub and is used to create working copies
	A branch is used in all of the above scenarios, and is used to temporarily try something without changing the master branch
	
What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    Git can know the most recent commit on both local and remote repositories without the need of a persistant Internet connection. This means that you can continue to work offline while still having a reasonable assumption about the online version status
    
How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?
